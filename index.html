## Conclusion?

class: img50
### - Don't copy others. They're doing it wrong.

--

![](googlegoogle.png)]

--

### - Rumors spread.
???
- great interviewers get all the benefits. It's stressful, memoable moment for people. Use it!
- not only your company's, but also yours.

# We are always **looking** for talented individuals to join ClearScore...
???
- every company do. For years. :)
- a company must be growing individuals.
- most efforts that a company is spending on LOOKING must be spent on GROWING.
- the best developers I hired were NEVER GREAT and they never felt talented. they come from shitty environment. give examples.

---
class: center, middle
# Great developers are **raised**, not hired.
???
- stop looking for great developers, start growing them.

---
class: center, middle
# We should hire developers that, under proper **mentorship**, will become great.
### (in a reasonable time)
???
- mentorship requires time. 
- the role of the best tech people is to mentor others (with pair programming)
- what if you need to hire 100 people? well, fire CTO and stop it... Insta, Nabrdalik.

### We'd ask the candidate to implement, using TDD, a function returning n-th Fibonacci number.  We'd give them both the math definition and a table with examples as well as a skeleton code with 2 failing tests... **Surprisingly, we had a lot of candidates who struggled miserably with this**.

# Homework FTW!

---
class: center, middle
## The homework was a bit too complex and, from the feedback we received, it took a good weekend to complete, and we had a large drop-off **because people couldn't be bothered**...
???
- well, I remember sending homework with UI... :) 
- candidates have really bad exprience. No feedback.

# **Give and Take**
## - Free code review
## - Sales pitch üöÄ
![](giveandtake.jpg)
???
- reciprocity.
- you are not the inteviewer anymore. You are doing work, too.
- the best icebreaker, because candidate listen to for 10 mins and will get relaxed
- when candidates are comfortable, they perform their true best, which actually makes interviews more predictive.

### - Make someone's day special vs. ~~interviewing~~
???
even if you won't make a hire, they will come back. Or spread a word.
