# We are always **looking** for talented individuals to join ClearScore...
???
- every company do. For years. :)
- a company must be growing individuals.
- most efforts that a company is spending on LOOKING must be spent on GROWING.
- the best developers I hired were NEVER GREAT and they never felt talented. they come from shitty environment. give examples.

# Great developers are **raised**, not hired.
???
- stop looking for great developers, start growing them.

# We should hire developers that, under proper **mentorship**, will become great.
### (in a reasonable time)
???
- mentorship requires time. 
- the role of the best tech people is to mentor others (with pair programming)
- you will

## The homework was a bit too complex and, from the feedback we received, it took a good weekend to complete, and we had a large drop-off **because people couldn't be bothered**...
